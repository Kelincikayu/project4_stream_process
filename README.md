Fast Track Data Engineering Project - Fraud Detection
This project is part of our journey in the Fast Track Data Engineering Program with Digital Skola. The objective of this project is to integrate Apache Kafka and PostgreSQL for real-time data streaming and storage, and apply a machine learning model to detect potential fraud.

Project Overview
Technologies Used
Apache Kafka: Used for real-time data streaming, managed with Docker Compose.
PostgreSQL: Database used for storing historical data.
Machine Learning: A pre-trained model provided by our tutor to detect fraud.
Project Steps
Setup and Configuration:

Apache Kafka was set up using Docker Compose to handle streaming data.
PostgreSQL was used to store the data.
Data Integration:

Combined real-time data from Kafka with existing data in PostgreSQL.
Machine Learning:

Applied a machine learning model to detect potential fraud in the integrated data.
Results
A sample of 503 records was taken from both Kafka and PostgreSQL.
The machine learning model was run on this dataset to detect fraud.
The result indicated 100% White List, meaning no fraud was detected.
Conclusion
This project provided hands-on experience with integrating streaming data using Apache Kafka, managing data in PostgreSQL, and applying machine learning for fraud detection. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our setup, though further investigation with more data and diverse scenarios would be beneficial.
